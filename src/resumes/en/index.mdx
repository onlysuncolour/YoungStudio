## EXPERIENCE

### [Shushu Information Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd](https://www.thinkingdata.io/) 2021.06-2024
> Shushu, aka thingkingdata, is the global advanced big data analytics service provider for gaming.  

**Frontend Expert**  
**Led the Thinkingdata Engine Frontend Team**
* With our team, built [Thinking Engine](https://demo-ta.thinkingdata.io/demo/index.html)'s analytics system. 
* Optimized performance by refactoring the logic of building analyze indicators and conditions, and offscreen rendering echarts.
* Explored low code pattern.
* Developed [Frontend E2E Testing Platform](https://www.youngliu.fun/posts/frontend-e2e-test)
* Focused on increacing work efficiency.

#### [Thinking Engine](https://demo-ta.thinkingdata.io/demo/index.html)
> Thinking Engine, the main product of Shushu, is a data analytics platform. The most important and useful part is generating graph and charts by building simple or complex analyze indicators.  

In this project, I was in charge of the analytics part at the very beginning. And after two years, took in charge of the whole project, leading 3 front-end developers.
* Built analytics system and maintained the whole project.
* Refactored the logic of [building analyze indicators and conditions](https://www.youngliu.fun/posts/b2b-data)
* Explored low code pattern, rebuilt analytics system by using configuration file and configurable components.

#### [Frontend E2E Testing Platform](https://www.youngliu.fun/posts/frontend-e2e-test)
> This project was self-organized, spontaneously implemented and motivated by our perfect relations with QA team.  
  At that time, there were several new projects being raised, and QA mates can't cover whole projects.

We use playwright to be the engine and we built a whole e2e testing environment around it, like chrome extension for case recording, platform, case running flow.
* Transformed our project to make it testable.
* Developed chorme extension for case recording
* Built testing platform to show cases, run cases, and manage cases.

#### [Independent Frontend Project Deployment](https://www.youngliu.fun/posts/frontend-envs)
> This project was developed totally because of tired of asking operations engineer for containers/servers to deploy our frontend project.  
  Before this project online, frontend project, backend project and db must be deployed in the same container/server. There was no such thing like deploy frontend project in independent container/server which could access backend by nginx or nodejs.

I use simple Nodejs to proxy all routers to the specific frontend page or specific backend host. You could see details from [my own page](https://www.youngliu.fun/posts/frontend-envs)
* Using Express to proxy all routers
* Be used over 1200 times in one year by 12 members. Had saved a lot of time and money.

#### [Frontend Environment Switch Helper](https://www.youngliu.fun/posts/env-switch)
> Our environments/dockers/containers were increasing so quickly with our company's expanding and feature's increacing, as well as bugs. 
  It's not convinent that you need to update your webpack proxy config when you need to access another backend host.
  In that case, we built this chrome extension to make everything easy.

Using this helper, when you click a host in list, helper will send a request to webpack dev server. Webpack dev server will update proxy host depend on the helper request.  
The help is also integrated with many functions, like login the system by username/password we set in helper, sync data to/from our platform, top/archive any host, open the host page when you click and current page is not in dev mode.
* Refactored webpack dev server config, especially proxy part.
* Created a chrome extension, implemented all functions.
